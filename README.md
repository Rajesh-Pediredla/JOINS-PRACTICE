##DESCRIPTION## :-
          This script creates two tables: `Employees` and `Departments`, inserts sample data, and demonstrates SQL join operations to combine data meaningfully. It performs:
          
          1. **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows with matching `DepartmentID` in both tables.
          2. **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from `Employees`, with `NULL` for unmatched departments.
          3. **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from `Departments`, with `NULL` for unmatched employees.
          4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Combines all rows from both tables, with `NULL` for unmatched rows.
          
          The script highlights how to use different join types to analyze relational data effectively.
